To run samples, [register a new Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps), configure a bot user, and OAuth redirect URL to http://localhost:9292 (for development). Configure your development environment by editing `.env` and setting the client ID and secret you were given during registration.

```
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=1111111111.2222222
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=abcdef012345679
PORT=9292
```

Run tests with `bundle exec rake`.
