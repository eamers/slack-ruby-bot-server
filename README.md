Build a complete Slack bot service with Slack button integration, in Ruby.

If you are not familiar with Slack bots or Slack API concepts, you might want to watch [this video](http://code.dblock.org/2016/03/11/your-first-slack-bot-service-video.html).

A good [open-source demo](https://github.com/dblock/slack-strava) of a service built on top of this library is [Strava integration with Slack](https://slava.playplay.io).

### What is this?

A library that contains a [Grape](http://github.com/ruby-grape/grape) API serving a [Slack Ruby Bot](https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-bot) to multiple teams. This gem combines a web server, a RESTful API and multiple instances of [slack-ruby-bot](https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-bot). It integrates with the [Slack Platform API](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/launch-platform-114754258b91#.od3y71dyo). Your customers can use a Slack button to install the bot.

### Stable Release

You're reading the documentation for the **next** release of slack-ruby-bot-server. Please see the documentation for the [last stable release, v0.11.1](https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-bot-server/blob/v0.11.1/README.md) unless you're integrating with HEAD. See [UPGRADING](UPGRADING.md) when upgrading from an older version.

### Try Me

A demo version of the [sample app with mongoid](sample_apps/sample_app_mongoid) is running on Heroku at [slack-ruby-bot-server.herokuapp.com](https://slack-ruby-bot-server.herokuapp.com). Use the _Add to Slack_ button. The bot will join your team as _@slackbotserver_.

Once a bot is registered, you can invite to a channel with `/invite @slackbotserver` interact with it. DM "hi" to it, or say "@slackbotserver hi".

### Run Your Own

You can use one of the [sample applications](sample_apps) to bootstrap your project and start adding slack command handlers on top of this code. A database is required to store teams.

### MongoDB

Use MongoDB with [Mongoid](https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid) as ODM. Configure the database connection in `mongoid.yml`. Add the `mongoid` gem in your Gemfile.

```
gem 'mongoid'
gem 'kaminari-mongoid'
gem 'mongoid-scroll'
gem 'slack-ruby-bot-server'
```

See the [sample app using Mongoid](sample_apps/sample_app_mongoid) for more information.

### ActiveRecord

Use ActiveRecord with, for example, PostgreSQL via [pg](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg). Configure the database connection in `postgresql.yml`. Add the `activerecord`, `pg`, `otr-activerecord` and `cursor_pagination` gems to your Gemfile.

```
gem 'pg'
gem 'activerecord', require: 'active_record'
gem 'slack-ruby-bot-server'
gem 'otr-activerecord'
gem 'cursor_pagination'
```

See the [sample app using ActiveRecord](sample_apps/sample_app_activerecord) for more information.

### Usage

Start with one of the samples above, which contain a couple of custom commands, necessary dependencies and tests, then [create a new Slack App](https://api.slack.com/applications/new).

![](images/create-app.png)

Follow Slack's instructions, note the app client ID and secret, give the bot a default name, etc. The redirect URL should be the location of your app. For local testing purposes use a public tunneling service such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose local port 9292.

Within your application, edit your `.env` file and add `SLACK_CLIENT_ID=...` and `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=...` in it.

Run `bundle install` and `foreman start` to boot the app. Navigate to [localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292). You should see an "Add to Slack" button. Use it to install the app into your own Slack team.

### OAuth Code Grant

The "Add to Slack" button uses the standard OAuth code grant flow as described in the [Slack docs](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth#flow).

The button itself contains a link that looks like this:

```
https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?scope=bot&client_id=<%= ENV['SLACK_CLIENT_ID'] %>
```

Once clicked, the user is taken through the authorization process at Slack's site. Upon successful completion, a callback containing a temporary code is sent to the redirect URL you specified. The endpoint at that URL contains code that looks like this:

```ruby
# Instantiate a web client
client = Slack::Web::Client.new

# Request a token using the temporary code
rc = client.oauth_access(
  client_id: ENV['SLACK_CLIENT_ID'],
  client_secret: ENV['SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET'],
  code: params[:code]
)

# Pluck the token from the response
token = rc['bot']['bot_access_token']
```

The token is stored in persistent storage and used each time a Slack client is instantiated for the specific team.

### API

This library implements an app, [SlackRubyBotServer::App](lib/slack-ruby-bot-server/app.rb), a service manager, [SlackRubyBotServer::Service](lib/slack-ruby-bot-server/service.rb) that creates multiple instances of a bot server class, [SlackRubyBotServer::Server](lib/slack-ruby-bot-server/server.rb), one per team.

#### App

The app instance checks for a working database connection, ensures indexes, performs migrations, sets up bot aliases and log levels. You can introduce custom behavior into the app lifecycle by subclassing `SlackRubyBotServer::App` and creating an instance of the child class in `config.ru`.

```ruby
class MyApp < SlackRubyBotServer::App
  def prepare!
    super
    deactivate_sleepy_teams!
  end

  private

  def deactivate_sleepy_teams!
    Team.active.each do |team|
      next unless team.sleepy?
      team.deactivate!
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby
MyApp.instance.prepare!
```

#### Service Manager

You can introduce custom behavior into the service lifecycle via callbacks. This can be useful when new team has been registered via the API or a team has been deactivated from Slack.

```ruby
instance = SlackRubyBotServer::Service.instance

instance.on :created do |team, error, options|
  # a new team has been registered
end

instance.on :deactivated do |team, error, options|
  # an existing team has been deactivated in Slack
end

instance.on :error do |team, error, options|
  # an error has occurred
end
```

The following callbacks are supported. All callbacks receive a `team`, except `error`, which receives a `StandardError` object.

| callback       |  description                                                     |
|:--------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| error          | an error has occurred                                            |
| creating       | a new team is being registered                                   |
| created        | a new team has been registered                                   |
| booting        | the service is starting and is connecting a team to Slack        |
| booted         | the service is starting and has connected a team to Slack        |
| stopping       | the service is about to disconnect a team from Slack             |
| stopped        | the service has disconnected a team from Slack                   |
| starting       | the service is (re)connecting a team to Slack                    |
| started        | the service has (re)connected a team to Slack                    |
| deactivating   | a team is being deactivated                                      |
| deactivated    | a team has been deactivated                                      |


The [Add to Slack button](https://api.slack.com/docs/slack-button) also allows for an optional `state` parameter that will be returned on completion of the request. The `creating` and `created` callbacks include an options hash where this value can be accessed (to check for forgery attacks for instance).
```ruby
auth = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest("SHA256", "key", "data")
```
```html
<a href="https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?scope=bot&client_id=<%= ENV['SLACK_CLIENT_ID'] %>&state=#{auth)"> ... </a>
```
```ruby
instance = SlackRubyBotServer::Service.instance
instance.on :creating do |team, error, options|
  raise "Unauthorized response" unless options[:state] == auth
end
```

A number of extensions use service manager callbacks to implement useful functionality.

#### Server Class

You can override the server class to handle additional events, and configure the service to use it.

```ruby
class MyServer < SlackRubyBotServer::Server
  on :hello do |client, data|
    # connected to Slack
  end

  on :channel_joined do |client, data|
    # the bot joined a channel in data.channel['id']
  end
end

SlackRubyBotServer.configure do |config|
  config.server_class = MyServer
end
```

#### Service Class

You can override the service class to handle additional methods.

```ruby
class MyService < SlackRubyBotServer::Service
  def url
    'https://www.example.com'
  end
end

SlackRubyBotServer.configure do |config|
  config.service_class = MyService
end

SlackRubyBotServer::Service.instance # MyService
SlackRubyBotServer::Service.instance.url # https://www.example.com
```

### Access Tokens

By default the implementation of [Team](lib/slack-ruby-bot-server/models/team) stores a `bot_access_token` as `token` that grants a certain amount of privileges to the bot user as described in [Slack OAuth Docs](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth) along with `activated_user_access_token` that represents the token of the installing user. You may not want a bot user at all, or may require different auth scopes, such as `users.profile:read` to access user profile information via `Slack::Web::Client#users_profile_get`. To change required scopes make the following changes.

1) Configure your app to require additional scopes in Slack API under _OAuth_, _Permissions_
2) Change the _Add to Slack_ buttons to require the additional scope, eg. `https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?scope=bot,users.profile:read&client_id=...`
3) The access token with the requested scopes will be stored as `activated_user_access_token`.

You can see a sample implementation in [slack-sup#3a497b](https://github.com/dblock/slack-sup/commit/3a497b436d25d3a7738562655cda64b180ae0096).
